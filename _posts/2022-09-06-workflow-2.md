Second entry in a series that takes a closer look at how we actually get our driving simulation experiment from paper to the simulator. This time, we focus on project where the workflow ended up being very different from our [previous entry](/workflow-1).

# Context

Whereas the previous project involved researchers acustomed to driving simulation, this new project is from a biomechanics lab, where the subject of immersive simulation is completely outside of the usual experiment realm. Which means multiple things: they don't really know what's possible and what isn't, nor how things go "from paper to simulator".

Which is actually really good! Because if your mind isn't stuck in some old ways of doing things, it's much easier to do some great new things.
