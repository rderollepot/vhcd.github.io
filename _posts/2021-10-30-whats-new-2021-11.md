What have we been up to since the [last update](/whats-new-2021-08)? It's been three months, so it's time to share some of what we've made, seen and heard!

# DSC

September was the annual time for the [Driving Simulation Conference](https://dsc2021.org/) (a.k.a. DSC). I was really looking forward to Epic's keynote (Sébastien Lozé), but it was mostly rehashed content from [Unreal Build: Automotive 2021](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/events/unreal-build-automotive-2021), with some random Metaverse added on top. So pretty no real news on the Epic front.

If I had only one thing to mention from DSC, it was the new LED wall trend, as shown by [Cruden](https://www.cruden.com/). That technology seem to have a lot of advantages over traditional projector/screen displays, and we'd really like to try that. The price, however, is pretty prohibitive for us.

# SIMAX

In our last update, we mentioned that we [started working](/whats-new-2021-08#simax) on porting our new simulation software to SIMAX, which is our Peugeot 308 simulator. Things have been moving along, encountering some bumps along the road, but nothing major.

Currently, we can drive using the real car controls (including gear shift) in the simulated world, which is projected onto the 9 main displays, covering over 270° of field of view. Performance isn't perfect right now, but we already have plans for that: our scene is very under-optimized, and we have a complete hardware upgrade scheduled next year.

In the meantime, one of the last step to getting everything up and runtime is mirrors. In a previous article, I [talked about mirrors](/ndisplay#mirrors) being especially tricky to deal with in a simulator; they have a different view origin and are flipped horizontally. For that last point, I recently found out about [output remapping](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/WorkingWithMedia/IntegratingMedia/nDisplay/Configuration#postprocessconfigurations), which allows doing exactly that, so that one thing less to worry about.

# Automation

I already wrote a [whole article](/scripts) about automation, but we're still actively improving that front, this time focusing on "cluster management". What we call a cluster is the network of computers actually powering the simulation in nDisplay-based simulator.

Managing a cluster is quite challenging, especially if you want the end-user (i.e. the experimenter) to be able to work with it in the easiest way possible, all the while making sure that everything is properly configured and minimizing risk of human errors.

And the core of our cluster, we use [Veyon](https://veyon.io/), which even though isn't really made for that use case, is a really great tool for it. In its latest release, the tool has full support for CLI, so we leveraged on that to automate all that can be: powering on/off, starting/stopping the simulation, deploying packaged builds, configuring new cluster node (i.e. computers), and so on.

We even bought some [Stream Decks](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck) so that each experimenter can configure its own button layout, perfectly optimized for the experiment they're running. Remembering which keybind does what is a thing of the past!
