What have we been up to since the [last update](/whats-new-2021-08)? It's been three months, so it's time to share some of what we've made, seen and heard!

# DSC

September was the annual time for the [Driving Simulation Conference](https://dsc2021.org/) (a.k.a. DSC). I was really looking forward to Epic's keynote (Sébastien Lozé), but it was mostly rehashed content from [Unreal Build: Automotive 2021](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/events/unreal-build-automotive-2021), with some random Metaverse added on top. So pretty no real news on the Epic front.

If I had only one thing to mention from DSC, it was the new LED wall trend, as shown by [Cruden](https://www.cruden.com/). That technology seem to have a lot of advantages over traditional projector/screen displays, and we'd really like to try that. The price, however, is pretty prohibitive for us.

# SIMAX

In our last update, we mentioned that we [started working](/whats-new-2021-08#simax) on porting our new simulation software to SIMAX, which is our Peugeot 308 simulator. Things have been moving along, encountering some bumps along the road, but nothing major.

Currently, we can drive using the real car controls (including gear shift) in the simulated world, which is projected onto the 9 main displays, covering over 270° of field of view. Performance isn't perfect right now, but we already have plans for that: our scene is very under-optimized, and we have a complete hardware upgrade scheduled next year.

In the meantime, one of the last step to getting everything up and runtime is mirrors.
