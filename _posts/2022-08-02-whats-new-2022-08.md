[One year ago](/whats-new-2021-08/) I started this quarterly report about the new things going on in our little driving simulation adventure. And deep in this (hot) summer, it's time for an update!

# Virtual Driver

In a [recent post](/workflow-1/#traffic), I mentionned that we heavily rely on our [Virtual Driver](/virtual-driver)'s Smart Feature; so those got a fair bit of work in the past months.

First of all, the "Smart" Virtual Driver learned that you *do* need to slowdown if you're turning in a junction. Since it could already stop at traffic lights, it can now handle most of our intersections without us having to explicitly tell what to do.

While at it, I refactored those "Smart Features" into a more modular architecture, clearly splitting them and making it easier to add any new ones.

On a more technical side, I've greatly improved the [OpenDRIVE](/opendrive)'s track coordinate solving in junctions, which relies on [esmini](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/)'s RoadManager. Since OpenDRIVE junctions are just a whole bunch of overlapping lanes connecting all incoming roads, it's quite tricky for the coordinate translator to know which one of those you're actually on when crossing the junction. But since the Virtual Driver knows where it's going, that knowledge is used to help the coordinate translator select the correct junction road. And since we [automate ego](/scenario-authoring/#automate-ego) in all our scenarios, it also works for real-driver vehicles, yay!

# Pedestrians

One of our research topic is Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), so we're always trying to expand our collection of pedestrians, riders and more. Some can be bought on the [Marketplace][mp], but most of them require some work on our side.

One recent addition is this wheelchair, which itself [is available](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/rigged-wheelchair-pack-10-in-1) on the Marketplace; but for which we still had to add some Blueprint magic in order to have the user's motion be somewhat believable.

We also migrated our main pedestrians from [ALS](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/advanced-locomotion-system-v1) to a custom lightweight [Animation Blueprint](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/animation-blueprints-in-unreal-engine). ALS is really amazing (and free!), but it has a lot of features that we really don't need for VRUs. We still kept the `Overlay States` idea, which allows us to simply choose the character state (e.g., listening to music, texting) from a simple drop-down menu. And the list of available states keeps growing, as the Marketplace has a near infinite supply of animations.

And since we want our pedestrians to maybe stop and look at a shop window, or get their smartphone out to look for a notication, we added a few new custom [Trigger Boxes](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/trigger-volume-actors-in-unreal-engine/) that enable us to do just that in a few click. So now our pedestrians are more alive than ever, without this requiring heavy work to actually use in our [scenarios](/scenarios).

# Research Projects

We currently have two research projects which involve our platform, one of which (NEWMOB) was the focus of a [recent post](/workflow-1).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This entire <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DrivingSimulation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DrivingSimulation</a> scene (WIP) is being created by a colleague, who happened to be a... psychology researcher! They&#39;re very talented *and* dedicated. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnrealEngine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UnrealEngine</a> + <a href="https://twitter.com/UnrealMarket?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UnrealMarket</a> really empower us to create amazing immersive worlds for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Transportation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Transportation</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Research?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Research</a>. <a href="https://t.co/DYrHvH23bd">pic.twitter.com/DYrHvH23bd</a></p>&mdash; Bertrand Richard (@brifsttar) <a href="https://twitter.com/brifsttar/status/1542520672689172486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We recently finished our first (of two) scenario for this project. As it is the first time using Unreal for both the simulation engineer and the researcher (both being simulation veterans), it is quite a journey for us all. But we're all so happy with what we've made so far, and we can't wait to actually run this amazing scene and scenario in our [largest simulator](/whats-new-2022-05/#simax).

The other project (MoniPost) should be the focus of the next blog entry, so I won't go into too much details here. It's a much smaller project, but it involves researchers from a lab that have never done driving simulation before, or any kind immersive simulation for that matter. So it's really fun to introduce our wonderful immersive worlds and related tools to people who never thought about all the opportunities those could bring to them.

# Marketplace

Last but definitely not least, we expanded our [Vault][vault] with dozens of new products from the [Marketplace][mp], ideal for our current projects.

* [lyoshko](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/lyoshko)'s latest [Velocity Car Pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/velocity-cars-pack) is without a doubt the best car pack on the Marketplace
* [Der Sky](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Der+Sky)'s [Car Wash](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/modular-car-wash-vol-1), [Bus Station](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/modular-bus-station-vol-1) and [Tunnel](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/modular-tunnel-collection-vol-1) are must-have for everyone in driving simulation
* [Meik.W](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Meik.W+Models) keeps on adding buildings: [General Store](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/general-store), [Police Department](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/police-department-01), [Clothes Shop](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/modern-clothes-shop) and many more

Those three are by far my favorite creators, and their products alone cover a very wide range of needs. But that's not all: how about an [amusement park](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/amusement-theme-park-rides-and-props), a very detailed [road material](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/realistic-customizable-roads), [fake interiors](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/wParallax) or [old lady animations](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/old-lady-anims)? Those are just a few recent additions to our [Vault][vault], but the [Marketplace][mp] has so much more great products to help us (and you) in our projects.
