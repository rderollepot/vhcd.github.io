[One year ago](/whats-new-2021-08/) I started this quarterly report about the new things going on in our little driving simulation adventure. And deep in this (hot) summer, it's time for an update!

# Virtual Driver

Better track coord in junctions
Smart slow junction
Smart refactor = all smart features work together

# Marketplace

Last but definitely not least, we expanded our [Vault][vault] with dozens of new products from the [Marketplace][mp], ideal for our current projects.

* [lyoshko](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/lyoshko)'s latest [Velocity Car Pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/velocity-cars-pack) is without a doubt the best car pack on the Marketplace
* [Der Sky](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Der+Sky)'s [Car Wash](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/modular-car-wash-vol-1), [Bus Station](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/modular-bus-station-vol-1) and [Tunnel](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/modular-tunnel-collection-vol-1) are must-have for everyone in driving simulation
* [Meik.W](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Meik.W+Models) keeps on adding buildings: [General Store](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/general-store), [Police Department](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/police-department-01), [Clothes Shop](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/modern-clothes-shop) and many more

Those three are by far my favorite creators, and their products alone cover a very wide range of needs. But that's not all: how about an [amusement park](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/amusement-theme-park-rides-and-props), a very detailed [road material](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/realistic-customizable-roads), [fake interiors](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/wParallax) or [old lady animations](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/old-lady-anims)? Those are just a few recent additions to our [Vault][vault], but the [Marketplace][mp] has so much great product to help us (and you) in our projects.
