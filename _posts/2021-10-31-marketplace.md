title: Unreal Marketplace products from Driving Simulation
---
For us, one of the major benefit of using Unreal Engine is its [Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/store). It offers the ability to purchase so much products, at very reasonable prices, and that work out-of-the-box. It saved us countless amount of time and money, compared to our previous workflows. However, finding the right products for your needs is not always easy, so I thought I'd share the list of product we own, our favorites, and some comments on them.

Note before we start: I recently wrote a [small script](https://github.com/brifsttar/UnrealMarketplaceVaultExtractor) to extract the content of one's  [Vault](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/vault), which is what led to this article.
