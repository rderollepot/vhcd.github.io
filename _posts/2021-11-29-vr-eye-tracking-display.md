title: Displaying live VR eye-tracking data
---
Eye-tracking is widely used to study driver's behavior in simulated environment. However, we're used to either have glasses (e.g. [Pupil Core](https://pupil-labs.com/products/core/)) or fixed (e.g [Smart Eye Pro](https://smarteye.se/research-instruments/se-pro/)); and the newly released VR headsets with included eye-tracking bring new challenges. The one we'll cover today is the visualization of live eye-tracking data.
