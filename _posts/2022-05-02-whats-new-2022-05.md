It's time to again look back at the last three months, and see what happened around our driving simulation world.

# Varjo XR-3

We received our first [Varjo XR-3](https://varjo.com/products/xr-3/), which if you read my [VR Headsets article](/vr-headsets), you know is probably the most exciting piece of hardware in the [XR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_reality) world at the moment.

I haven't been able to do much with it yet, but I've been very impressed so far, as can be seen from this Tweet...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Threw a random (dirty) green sheet over a closet and started the <a href="https://twitter.com/varjodotcom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@varjodotcom</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UE4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UE4</a> template. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s more impressive: the mixed reality (ðŸ¤¯), the headset resolution, the hand-tracking, or the fact that it took 5 minutes to setup. <a href="https://t.co/9SjfGCiRKw">pic.twitter.com/9SjfGCiRKw</a></p>&mdash; Bertrand Richard (@brifsttar) <a href="https://twitter.com/brifsttar/status/1506916028533678082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So things to note, though. First, the [Focus Area](https://varjo.com/use-center/get-to-know-your-headset/getting-the-perfect-image-quality/) is slightly below the horizon, meaning if you look straight ahead, that screen will only cover a small fraction of your [fovea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis). This is intentional, as this feature was added for extra accuracy on cockpits, so when the gaze is slightly lower. I've also had some trouble getting some features working ([Lab Tools](https://developer.varjo.com/lab-tools), [Depth Occlusion](https://developer.varjo.com/docs/unreal/depth-occlusion-with-unreal)), but support is really helpful.

Also worth mentioning that we're years away from having powerful enough GPUs to feed that beast. All displays combined, it's almost 12 megapixels at 90Hz. I'm hoping multi-GPU (e.g., [NVLink](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/nvlink-bridges/)) becomes a thing for such use cases, but I'm guessing it's a huge amount of work to get this done. In the meantime, the resolution on the XR-3 can be changed very easily, so we run on lower settings, which still looks better than our Vive Pro Eye.

We've got many things we want to try to do with this headset, and we're really just starting. We're confident it'll find many applications for different use cases that we might encounter.

# UE5

[Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5) is out! I've made an entire [article](/ue5) on that subject, so I won't go into details here. In a nutshell: all new features look promising, but it might be a bit early for us to jump ship from UE4. It's definitely the long-term plan, though, and I'm looking forward to playing with all the new toys!

# RoadRunner R2022a

Speaking of tools that received an update, [RoadRunner](https://mathworks.com/products/roadrunner.html) R2022a is out. I don't talk a lot about RoadRunner, but it's an integral part of [our workflow](/making-a-scene), allowing us to very easily create road networks (both 3D and [OpenDRIVE](/opendrive)).

The new release includes an [OpenSCENARIO](/scenarios/#openscenario)-compliant [Scenario Editor](https://mathworks.com/products/roadrunner-scenario.html), which I don't find will be of any use to us, as we [author scenarios](/scenario-authoring) straight in Unreal.

![rr_sidewalks.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/rr_sidewalks.png)

More interesting to us is the new [Datasmith](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/datasmith) Importer, making the connection between RoadRunner and Unreal ever so efficient. As pictured above, there's been improvements around heights, meaning we can now have nice sidewalk-road transition, which will be very helpful for upcoming projects. There's also an [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) importer, which always sounds nice on paper, but often has limited results, as OSM's level of accuracy isn't enough for OpenDRIVE networks.

![rr_roadstyles.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/rr_roadstyles.png)

RoadRunner has a lot of really great and intuitive features, one of which is the ability to very easily create custom road styles. So I did just that by adding a collection of french roads, mostly taken from my own neighborhood.
