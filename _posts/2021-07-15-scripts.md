title: Automating The Boring Stuff
---
In the past months, the languages I've used most in the V-HCD is [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell). Considering the V-HCD is powered by Unreal Engine, which has support for Blueprint, C++ and Python; you might wonder why do I write PowerShell script. The answer is: to automate the boring stuff. And there's lot of it.

# Context

To better understand what's there to automate, you have to understand our workflow. It's vaguely described in the [Version control](/version-control) article, but I'll try to explain it better here.

The VHCD is an Unreal Engine project (`vhcd.uproject`), and is versioned as a Git [superproject](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Git/Submodules_and_Superprojects) with the following stored in submodules:

* Marketplace products
* Plugins
* Custom assets
* Dependencies (e.g. [Virtual Driver](/virtual-driver))

When we develop a new experiment with the V-HCD, we [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the superproject for this experiment, and all developments specific to that experiment will be done in this fork. This fork is never intended to be merged; it instead will be frozen once the experiment starts, to always have a copy of the exact software used to run the experiment.

This means multiple things. First, any experiment is fully version controlled; which though is a great thing, it comes with its own challenges. Second, since we work with a copy of the platform's source code, we need to build it on the client side; we're not distributing a "ready to go" executable. This has the advantage of allowing faster release cycles, i.e. if I push a fix on the main repository, the user can just merge it and have it. No need to rebuild the engine or anything.
