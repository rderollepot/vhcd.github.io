title: StreamDeck for Driving Simulation Experiments
---
I'm always on the lookout for new and often out of place tools that could find their role in our research workflows. One example is [Veyon](https://veyon.io/): built for classroom computers management, it also happens to be perfect for managing [nDisplay clusters](/whats-new-2021-11/#automation), at the core of our simulators. [StreamDeck][sd] are a recent addition to our fleet, and today we'll discuss all the use cases in which those will greatly help.

# *Stream-*What now ?

What is a StreamDeck you may ask? Basically, it's a button box where each button has its own LCD display. There are various sizes, from 6 to 32 buttons. It comes with software, so you can bind pretty much anything on any button press.

Marketed towards [online streamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_streamer), the simple design and easy customization of those devices have lead them to be used in many applications beyond their target audience.

I first came across those when looking if [Art. Lebedev](https://www.artlebedev.com/)'s mid-2000s [Optimus Maximus keyboard](https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/maximus/) ever went into production, or if something similar made it to market. I thought such devices would easily be configured for various use cases at our lab, so once I discovered that StreamDecks where a thing, I quickly bought a couple to see what could be done with it.
