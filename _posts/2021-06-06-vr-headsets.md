For the past ten years, the world of [Virtual Reality headsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset) has been redefined, lead by Facebook's [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/) and HTC's [Vive](https://www.vive.com/). Those relatively cheap devices allow for better immersion in various types of environments, and are now being used in a wide range of both industry and research entities. But, even though we've previously mentionned our [CAVE](/nDisplay) simulator, we never talked about VR headsets. Why is that?
