title: VR Headsets
---
For the past ten years, the world of [Virtual Reality headsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset) has been redefined, lead by Facebook's [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/) and HTC's [Vive](https://www.vive.com/). Those relatively cheap devices allow for better immersion in various types of environments, and are now being used in a wide range of both industry and research entities. But, even though we've previously mentionned use of [CAVE](/nDisplay) simulators, we never talked about VR headsets. Why is that?

# Why we don't use them

The title is voluntarily misleading, as we own and use multiple VR headsets, but not for *driving simulation* just yet. The technology has been and is still improving a lot, and we've been playing with 3 generations of headsets for over 5 years now; using them for demos, *pedestrian simulation* or just internal testing. But we haven't used VR headsets for any *driving simulation* experiment, nor do we have any planned in the short term. And there are multiple reasons behind that.

## Low resolution

## Eye and face tracking

## Mirrors

## Dashboard interaction

# Why we will

## Manus-VR
