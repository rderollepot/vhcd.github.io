It's been three months since our [last update](/whats-new-2021-11), so it's time for our quarterly status update!

# Open-source

I've finally taken the time to clean up my codebase and open-source my [Unreal Engine OpenDRIVE Plugin](https://github.com/brifsttar/OpenDRIVE)! It's based on [esmini][esmini], which, if you read this blog, you may already know. This project has the best OpenDRIVE library, so my plugin is basically just a wrapper, with some nice added in-engine features, like landscape sculpting.

It's the first "real" project I open-source, so we'll see how it goes. Obviously, the plugin could have way more features (e.g., road mesh generation), but for now we don't have any major development in the pipeline, we mostly plan on maintaining it and add a few features here and there.

# Virtual Driver

The [Virtual Driver](/virtual-driver) underwent a major refactor. It was previously an external lib (built on top of [esmini][esmini]) to be engine-agnostic, but since we only use it in Unreal Engine, that abstract layer was more trouble than it's worth. So we moved the codebase from esmini to its own Unreal Engine plugin, which also implied splitting it from the OpenDRIVE plugin, since both of them were tangled.

This means the Virtual Driver now has a tighter integration within the engine, and can interact more easily with it. We'll have an example of that just below.

The Virtual Driver learned to use the [reverse](https://twitter.com/brifsttar/status/1465399171440156672) gear. We plan on using it in an upcoming project, and I always wanted to implement it anyway. It turned out to be much easier than I imagined. The existing design is easily compatible with such change, so it really didn't take much time.

And as an example of what a tighter Unreal integration means for the Virtual Driver, you can see our debug display on the video above: the planed trajectory is plotted, and the [pure pursuit point](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub3/coulter_r_craig_1992_1/coulter_r_craig_1992_1.pdf) is also shown along it. Really nice to have that on screen when you try to understand why the car isn't doing what you want it to.
