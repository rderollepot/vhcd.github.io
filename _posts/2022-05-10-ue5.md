title: Unreal Engine 5 for Driving Simulation
---
[Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5) is out, with quite a bunch of amazing features. Today we'll explore what this means for our platform, and for driving simulation overall.

Before we get into specifics, you can check Sébastien Lozé's post titled "[Simulation benefits coming from UE5](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/simulation-benefits-coming-from-ue5-s%25C3%25A9bastien-loz%25C3%25A9/)", which gives a great overview of UE5 for simulation applications, as ours.

# The Matrix Awakens (CitySample)

If you don't know what UE5 is about, one way to see what's new is just watching (or playing) [The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/wakeup). That tech demo is an absolutely amazing and jaw-dropping masterpiece of realtime rendering.

Not only is there a video, a demo (on consoles), insightful [tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usJrcwN6T4I) [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLVJP-o0g28), but you can actually download the [whole project](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/city-sample) on the Marketplace! This just blows my mind, all of that available *for free*.

So as someone who develops driving simulators, when I see a big city, with tens of thousands of vehicles and pedestrians, stunning visuals, all that running in realtime on modern hardware, and available right now; I am *very* excited.

# Nanite and Lumen

[Nanite](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/nanite-virtualized-geometry-in-unreal-engine/) and [Lumen](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/lumen-global-illumination-and-reflections-in-unreal-engine/) probably are the two headlining features for UE5, and rightly so. However, their impact on driving simulation might not be as important as it'll be for other fields.

Nanite is obviously a big deal: not having to worry about triangle count is huge. It'll allow us to create even more immersive environments, with more details, more accuracy. But Nanite really shines by allowing super high-resolution meshes to be used, bringing the smallest of object's details to our world. Which, when you're behind the wheel of a car, moving at rather high speed, doesn't seem as important as it can be in a first or third person game. Nanite also requires DirectX 12, which doesn't really play nice with [OpenXR and Varjo](https://developer.varjo.com/docs/unreal/unreal-openxr-roadmap). Still, I'll gladly take those free triangles, thank you very much!

Lumen will bring a new level of realism when it comes to lighting, something we've truly never seen in any driving simulator out there. *But*... it's still considered [Experimental](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/unreal-engine-5-0-release-notes/#virtualproduction) for [nDisplay](/ndisplay), and doesn't really work with VR headsets right now, from what I understand. Obviously, Epic is working on it, and I can't wait for Lumen to be truly available for our use case.

# World Partition and OFPA

When UE5's features were announced in more details, [World Partition](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/world-partition-in-unreal-engine/) was the one that really caught my eye.

# Mass and ZoneGraph

# Chaos Vehicles

# Human Skeleton
