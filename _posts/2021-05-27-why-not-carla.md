title: Why not CARLA?
---
> [CARLA](http://carla.org/) is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions.

Seeing how close it is to our platform, one common question we're asked is why we didn't build it on top of CARLA, given that we even chose to same engine as them. That's what we'll explain today.

# Disclaimer

Given the subject, this blog entry will obviously not put CARLA in the best of light. But you should keep in mind that all of this is from the point of view of someone working on *driving simulation*, which is not CARLA's target audience. Over the years, the team behind CARLA managed to build an amazing open-source tool, and highlighting some shortcomings doesn't change any of that.

# Scripting

## One more language

Another editor

## Incomplete interface

Too high level

## Bridging the gap

Making things available in py
nDIsplay

# Not a *driving simulator*

Useless features for us

# Re-implementing the wheel

Many MP products redev

# Too early

not 1.0, quality not perfect (e.g. opendrive)

# What could have been?

re: simulation email
py/ml integration, everything else in-editor (euw/eubp)
