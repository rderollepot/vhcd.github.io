title: Why not CARLA?
---
> [CARLA](http://carla.org/) is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions.

Seeing how close it is to our platform, one common question we're asked is why we didn't build it on top of CARLA, given that we even chose to same engine as them. That's what we'll explain today.
