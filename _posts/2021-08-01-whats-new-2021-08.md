What have we been up to in the past couple of months? What's new in the V-HCD world? This post is a first of a hopefully long series where we showcase the new things in our driving simulation world.

# Virtual Driver

Our [Virtual Driver](/virual-driver) has learned *not* to follow the lane's center, with its new "Swerve" goal. This can be used for example to deviate from the lane to avoid an obstacle or overtake a bike. Alternatively, it can also be used if the Virtual Driver is driving a tractor on a road and kindly keeps on the right side to make overtaking it easier! Not a common use case I admit, but we recently added a tractor in the platform and I felt obliged to have that working.

# SIMAX

[SIMAX](https://lescot.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/equipements/simulateurs-de-conduite/simax) is our main driving simulator platform, which currently includes 10 projectors, 2 monitors, a real car (Peugeot 308) and a dozen computers to power all that up. The V-HCD platform doesn't yet run on this hardware, mostly because it's been heavily used lately and we don't want to interfere with running experiments.

We started the process of getting the V-HCD on SIMAX by hooking the actual car to the platform. This means that we can drive a car in our UE4 virtual worlds using inputs from the Peugeot 308.

Next step obviously is to display said virtual worlds across all the screens. This will be done using [nDisplay](/ndisplay), but we'll wait for Unreal Engine 4.27 to drop, since it'll include an [nDisplay 3D Config Editor](https://portal.productboard.com/epicgames/1-unreal-engine-public-roadmap/c/317-ndisplay-3d-config-editor-beta) which I really want to try, since writting config file by hand isn't really my cup of tea.

# SUaaVE

[SUaaVE](https://www.suaave.eu/) is a European H2020 research project, where the V-HCD holds a key part for a wide range of activities. On our side, we're using it to study pedestrian and "Connected and Automated Vehicles" (CAV) interactions, with the intent of prototyping "external human machine interfaces" (eHMI) to help the CAV communicate with people, either inside or outside the car.

We've been using the V-HCD to create an experiment which includes scenarios from both the passenger and pedestrians point-of-views. We've also created innovative eHMI for the experiment, and we'll be able to get data on their effectiveness and acceptability.

Nothing to show just yet, as this is an ongoing research project, but I'm really eager to show all of this off.

# Pedestrian collisions

A researcher from LESCOT focuses on the visibility of vulnerable road users (VRU), and mostly works with simulation to (re)create complex situations. Therefore, they tend to have scenarios with critical interaction between car and VRU, which can sometime end in collision (depending on the driver's reaction).

Being able to also simulate the collision, and have the "victim" VRU react in a realistic manner, could be a great improvement on immersion. So we've worked on that, and we can now run over pedestrians and cyclists. This is still a work-in-progress, but we can definitely show some progress.

# Bicycles

We've been spending quite some time working on bicycles, which include bikes, riders and their respective animations. As a baseline, we started using [CARLA](https://carla.org/)'s bikes, and then we decided to make our own from that.

So first, we had to find city bikes (e.g. from bicycle-sharing services) 3D models. Then [rig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation) them to our skeleton. We also had to work on the bike animation, i.e. bike drive, pedals.

In parallel, we started working on the rider animation. We wanted a generic animation system (i.e. Animation Blueprint) that would work with all bikes, and wouldn't require new animations handmade for each. Our requirements included a wide range of animations: starting/stopping (foot on ground), pedaling, free-wheeling, arm movement to signal direction changes, head movement to look at other people in the scene. We're still not done through the list, but we've been able to do most of them in Blueprint only (with [IK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics)), and we're using our Manus-VR [Polygon](https://www.manus-vr.com/polygon) and [Prime gloves](https://www.manus-vr.com/mocap-gloves) to record the more complex movements, which we'll soon integrate into our Animation Blueprint (via blending).

All of this is a work in progress, but I really like what we have so far. And we've got plans for other vehicles than bicycle, so expect more on that area!
