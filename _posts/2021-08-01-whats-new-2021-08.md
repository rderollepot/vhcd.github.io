What have we been up to in the past couple of months? What's new in the V-HCD world? This post is a first of a hopefully long series where we showcase the new things in our driving simulation world.

# Virtual Driver

Our [Virtual Driver](/virual-driver) has learned *not* to follow the lane's center, with its new "Swerve" goal. This can be used for example to deviate from the lane to avoid an obstacle or overtake a bike. Alternatively, it can also be used if the Virtual Driver is driving a tractor on a road and kindly keeps on the right side to make overtaking it easier! Not a common use case I admit, but we recently added a tractor in the platform and I felt obliged to have that working.
