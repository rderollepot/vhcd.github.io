title: Scenario Authoring
---
We've already talked about [scenarios](/scenarios), which are at the very core of driving simulation. But this was a rather high level overview, and today I want to go a bit deeper to discuss how we're actually implementing our scenarios, and how we try to make the process as easy and efficient as possible

# Requirements

At [LESCOT](https://lescot.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/), we've been authoring a very wide range of scenarios for decades, and we've gathered a lot of feedback from it over the years. When we started working on our Unreal Engine platform, we use that to create a small set of requirements, ensuring that what we create fits our needs as best as possible.
