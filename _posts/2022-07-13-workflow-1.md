What's it like using Unreal Engine to actually implement a driving simulation experiment? What does that workflow look like? Well, we're kind of learning as we go along, and this post is a first of a series (well, maybe) that will look a bit closer at how things go from paper to simulator.

# Context

At the moment, we're building two different experiments using our shiny and new Unreal Engine simulation platform. One of them involves an simulation engineer and a psychology researcher who are both experts when it comes to driving simulation experiments, but whose technical expertise was built on an outdated and rather buggy simulation software. Those two colleagues are discovering the platform for the first time in this project, but they have rather high expectation in terms of [scenario](/scenario) given their experience on the subject, so this project is quite challenging for all of those involved.

The other project is quite the opposite, as it involves biomechanics researchers who have never been anywhere near driving simulation, and heavily rely on myself to help them build this part of the experiment. As beginners in the field, they don't expect to reach the moon on their first try, so this project is less ambitious in terms of scenario than the aforementioned.

So two projects, two teams, two differents skillsets and goals; how are we getting things done?

# Quick iterations

One of the key factor in making the engineer-researcher relationtionship work is frequent communication. Depending on the each part's investment in the project, and on the who-does-what, the communication can take many forms.

In any case, the base workflow is similar: we use [RoadRunner]()
