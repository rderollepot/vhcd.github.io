What's it like using Unreal Engine to actually implement a driving simulation experiment? What does that workflow look like? Well, we're kind of learning as we go along, and this post is a first of a series (well, maybe) that will look a bit closer at how things go from paper to simulator.

# Context

Before going into how we do things, we must discuss *who* does them. We have the luxury of having not one but two simulation engineers who can be involved in driving simulation experiments. Which is also why we're able to develop our own simulation platform in the first place. I'm one of those two, being more focused on the development of the platform itself, and the operation of our lower-scale simulator. My colleague handles our largest simulator hardware, and all the experiments running on it.

We work with researchers from various fields and background, meaning some have been deeply invested in driving simulation for decades, while others are doing their first immersive experiments. Our goal as simulation engineers is to tailor our workflow and processes to each profile, to ensure that each researcher can get the most out of our driving simulation making skills.

So the workflow discussed in this article definitely isn't the *one* workflow we decided on. It's what we landed on for this project, with team, given our relatively small experience with Unreal Engine. But that's what's empowering about using Unreal Engine: nothing is set in stone, and we can decide to work a very different way tomorrow if need be. And that's already happening, but that'll make for another post!
