"Here we go again" is what I planned on telling ChatGPT to have it write the introduction to our usual quarterly activity report; but "ChatGPT is at capacity right now", so I guess this will do?

# OpenDRIVE

My [OpenDRIVE plugin](https://github.com/brifsttar/OpenDRIVE) for Unreal Engine received some new feature. Nothing exactly ground-breaking, but still welcome.

Most notable addition probably is the new [Duplicate Actor Along Road](https://github.com/brifsttar/OpenDRIVE#duplicate-actor-along-road) Editor Utility, which I honestly don't know how I didn't think of making this sooner. I probably thought "I can already do that in RoadRunner", sure; but isn't doing that in Unreal *much better*? Yes it is.
